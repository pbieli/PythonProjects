Keylogger

Description
The Keylogger is a Python script that captures keystrokes from the user and writes them to a log file (keylog.txt). It utilizes the pynput library to monitor keyboard events in real-time and logs each keystroke along with special keys like "Shift", "Ctrl", etc. The script provides a simple yet effective way to monitor keyboard activity for various purposes such as debugging, user behavior analysis, or parental control.

Features
-Keystroke Logging: Captures all keystrokes from the user.
-Real-time Monitoring: Monitors keyboard events in real-time using the pynput library.
-Special Key Handling: Logs special keys such as "Shift", "Ctrl", "Alt", etc.
-Stop Mechanism: Allows the user to stop the keylogger by pressing the "End" key.

Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script file (keylogger.py).
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the script using the command line or terminal: python keylogger.py
4. The keylogger will start running and capturing keystrokes in the background.
5. Press the "End" key to stop the keylogger.
6. The captured keystrokes will be logged to a file named keylog.txt in the same directory as the script.

Requirements
Python 3.x
pynput library (install using pip install pynput)

Security and Privacy
-Use with Caution: While the keylogger script can be useful for legitimate purposes, it can also be misused for unauthorized surveillance. Ensure that you have appropriate permissions before using it.
-Privacy Considerations: Be mindful of privacy concerns when deploying the keylogger. Inform users and obtain consent before monitoring their keyboard activity.
