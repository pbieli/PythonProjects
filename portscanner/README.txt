Port Scanner Script

Developed a multi-threaded port scanning tool in Python using concurrent programming techniques.

-Utilized Python's concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor for efficient thread management.
-Implemented context managers for socket operations to ensure proper resource cleanup.
-Enhanced error handling to provide informative messages for various network-related exceptions.
-Enabled command-line interface using the argparse module for easy configuration.
-Contributed to the cybersecurity domain by creating a tool to identify open ports and potential vulnerabilities in network infrastructure.

Technologies Used: Python, concurrent programming, socket programming, command-line interface (CLI)
